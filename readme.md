# Introduction

The following tools was used to develop the SPA and although only simple demonstration due to time contraint but it does showcase the technology stack I am familiar with:

- React/redux/webpack
- React-Bootstrap for general styling and modal
- Typescript definition for strong type javascript
- eslint/prettier for well form code
- editor config for uniform formatting accross multiple dev and IDE

running the application is "npm i and npm start" and "npm test" to run test

## Production

The production config is incomplete (webpack.prod.js) but will use this to configure production builds

## todo

- shallow test for stateless components, mount for event testing
- add unit test
- refactoring
